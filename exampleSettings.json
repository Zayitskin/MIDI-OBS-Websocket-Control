This is an example file for understanding the configuation format for the MIDI OBS controller
THIS IS NOT VALID JSON! If you use this, the program WILL crash.

The settings file is comprised of an array of commands:
[
	Each command is an object with a:
		command - name of the OBS control command to be run
		          commands with (parenthesis) are paired together
			showSource - makes target source visible (hideSource)
			hideSource - makes target source invisible (showSource)
			toggleSource - inverts the target's visibility
			showAllSources - makes all sources visible (hideAllSources)
			hideAllSources - makes all sources invisible (showAllSources)
			transitionToScene - transitions to target scene
			transitionToPreviousScene - transitions to the last active scene
			                            only knows changes while program is active
		type - defines the trigger functionality of the command:
			open - triggers only on note_on
			closed - triggers only on note_off
			latch - triggers on both note_on and note_off
			mirror - triggers on note_on, and the paired command on note_off
			         if a command does not have a pair, acts like latch
		value - the value of the MIDI note that should trigger the command
		target - target of the command (if command has no target, field can be omitted)
